**Basic linear Regression:** 

This script is a practical application of data analysis in R for predicting startup business failures. It involves data preparation, visualization, and statistical modeling. Key steps include data cleaning, exploring categorical variables, and conducting correlation analysis. A logistic regression model is used to predict failures, achieving notable accuracy. The analysis identifies crucial factors like financial stability, employee experience, and innovation as significant predictors of success. 


**Breast Cancer DataSet:**

This R script is a detailed analysis pipeline, beginning with environment setup and data reading. It emphasizes data cleaning and feature engineering, including handling missing values and creating new metrics. The script utilizes Random Forest and XGBoost models for predictions, incorporating techniques like normalization and cross-validation. 


**First R Script:**

This R script focuses on analyzing real estate data. It starts with setting up the directory and reading data from a CSV file. The script employs data visualization techniques, including a box plot to compare house sale amounts against population categories and bar graphs to depict monthly sales counts. It uses ggplot2 for enhanced graphical representation. 


**Lasso and Ridge Regression:**

This R script is tailored for advanced data analysis, primarily focusing on credit scoring and income prediction. It begins with environment setup, data reading, and cleaning. The script employs various statistical techniques, including partitioning data for training and validation, decision tree modeling, and predictions. Key features include handling missing values, creating partitions for training and validation, and implementing both Lasso and Ridge regression models. 


**Learning To Read ScreePlots:**

This R script focuses on a Principal Component Analysis (PCA) of social media data. It starts by setting up the environment and loading necessary libraries, followed by data preprocessing including handling missing values and standardizing the data. The script then conducts PCA, visualizes the scree plot to determine the number of components to retain, and calculates the cumulative variance explained by each component. It also includes biplots for both individuals and variables for the first two principal components. 


**Random Forest with CV:**

This R script performs data analysis on a video games dataset. It includes preprocessing steps like reading data, handling missing values, and feature engineering. The script generates histograms and scatter plots for exploratory data analysis and conducts correlation analysis. It fits two linear models, comparing a basic model with an enhanced one including more predictors. A random forest model is also built for predicting game prices, followed by cross-validation for model tuning. 



# Python

Finance Manager Tool I made to keep track of my spendings. It also generates fake data for monthly spending that is used to make some data charts.
