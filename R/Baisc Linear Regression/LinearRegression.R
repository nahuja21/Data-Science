# Conclusion----------
# This logistic regression model was developed to predict startup business failure, and it achieved an accuracy of around 77%.
# From the model summary, features like Debt_Ratio, Age_of_Business, Innovation_Index, and Median_Work_Experience appear to be significant predictors. 
# For instance, as the Age_of_Business increases, the chances of success also seem to increase. 
# Conversely, startups with a higher Median_Work_Experience are more likely to fail, which is counterintuitive.
# From the confusion matrix, out of the startups predicted, 255 were correctly identified as unsuccesful and 390 were succesful.
# The model missclassified 100 startups as succesful when they weren't and 90 unsuccessful when they were.
# My recommendation is to focus on is financial Stability. Nothing is worse than a startup already in a lot of debt.
# As well as a company with employee with good work experience. Companies with a better median_work_experience tend to do better.
# Finally encourage startups to foster a culture of innovation. Given the significance of the Innovation Index, itâ€™s evident that innovative companies 
# have a competitive edge.
